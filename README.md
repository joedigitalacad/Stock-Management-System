# Stock-Management-System
This is a web application that was build to manage stocks in an organisation. Here, stock keepers will be able to upload new stocks in the system and employees in that organisation will be able to order goods from the stock keeper in case their gadget is bad or they need a new gadget to facilitate work at the organisation.
#Note
This system is to be used only inside an organisational setting where employees in that organisation will be able to ask for a laptop, mouse etc in case their mouse is not working properly or it is delaying work done.

#PURPOSE
This system was requested by a subsciber in my channel (joe digital academy) and it is meant for a video tutorial on youtube. you can access my channel to watch how this scipts where been written.
